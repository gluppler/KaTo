# KaTo: Tokenization, Normalization, and Lemmatization CLI-Based NLP Tool

## Overview

KaTo is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed specifically for **Tokenization**, **Normalization**, and **Lemmatization** in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Built entirely in Haskell using functional programming principles, KaTo provides a straightforward and efficient solution for processing text input.

## Logic Diagram

Below is a simplified logic diagram illustrating the flow of data in KaTo:

### Components of the Logic Diagram

1. **User Input Text**: The process begins with the user providing text input through the command line.
  
2. **Tokenization**: The text is split into individual tokens or words for further processing.

3. **Normalization**: Each token is standardized (e.g., lowercased, punctuation removed) to ensure consistency.

4. **Lemmatization**: The normalized tokens are transformed into their base forms (lemmas).

5. **Display Results**: The results of the tokenization, normalization, and lemmatization are formatted and prepared for display.

6. **User Receives Processed Output**: Finally, the user sees the processed output in the terminal.

## Setting Up KaTo

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Haskell and Cabal installed. Run:
   ```bash
   cabal update
   cabal install --only-dependencies
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   cabal build
   ```

---

## Using KaTo

1. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   cabal run
   ```

2. **Enter Text for Processing**: 
   When prompted, type or paste the text you want to analyze and press Enter.

3. **View Results**: 
   After processing, KaTo will display the tokens, normalized tokens, and lemmatized tokens.

### Example Usage

```bash
$ kato
Welcome to KaTo: A Tokenization, Normalization, and Lemmatization CLI-Based NLP Tool!
Please enter the text you want to process:
> The children are running quickly.
Tokens: ["The", "children", "are", "running", "quickly."]
Normalized Tokens: ["the", "children", "are", "running", "quickly"]
Lemmatized Tokens: ["the", "child", "be", "run", "quick"]
Process completed successfully.
```
