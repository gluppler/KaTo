# KaTo: Tokenization, Normalization, and Lemmatization CLI-Based NLP Tool

## Overview

KaTo is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed specifically for **Tokenization**, **Normalization**, and **Lemmatization** in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Built entirely in Haskell using functional programming principles, KaTo provides a straightforward and efficient solution for processing text input.

### Key Features

- **Tokenization**: Breaks down input text into meaningful tokens for easier analysis.
- **Normalization**: Standardizes tokens to a consistent format, including lowercasing and punctuation removal.
- **Lemmatization**: Converts words to their base forms, improving comprehension and analysis of the text.

### Why KaTo?

KaTo is ideal for students, researchers, and professionals in linguistics, data science, and artificial intelligence. Its user-friendly interface allows users to process text data without needing advanced programming skills.

### Installation

To get started with KaTo, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the [Installation Guide](LINK_TO_INSTALLATION_GUIDE) (replace with actual link).

### Usage

Run KaTo directly from the command line and enter your text for processing. KaTo will return tokens, normalized tokens, and lemmatized tokens for your input.

```bash
$ kato
